> ### Development
SubLoader is a fork from the well-known autosubs addon. It also contains some code from a Jen base addon. All credits go to the original developers.

I'm not a programmer; all I do is trial and error to find a possible solution. So please if someone wants to help out and to push this addon forward, be my guest.
